# Global-News-VR-Prototype

This is an interaction design on top of the XR Interaction toolkit. The experience prototypes a VR news reader that can be selected based on locations.

The interaction requires the controllers to work with and mainly uses the standard VR input for locomotion, grabbing and selection

### 🌍 : Use both hands and grab to move the earh around.

### 🌍 : Expand your arms while holding the grab keys to scale up. Move the hands closer to scale down. (Earth will not scale down than its original size)

### 🌍 : Use one hand and the grab key to rotate, release to stop rotation

### 🌍 : If the swipe is quick, the earth can freely spin

### 🌍 : Move your controller closer, point an item using the pointer to select an item

### 🌍 : Press the trigger to show the item. You can grab and move around

### 🌍 : Use the pointer and the trigger to interact with the news tablet
